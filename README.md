# Snake-Game
I'd be glad to provide key points about your SnakeMania game code that you can highlight in your CV under the projects section:

**Project Name:** SnakeMania - A Snake Game

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML: Used for structuring the web page layout, including the game board, score and high score displays.
* CSS: Responsible for styling the game elements (snake, food, board) with visually appealing colors, borders, and background images.
* JavaScript: The core logic behind the game's functionality. It handles:
    * Snake movement and direction changes based on keyboard input (arrow keys)
    * Food generation and collision detection
    * Scorekeeping and high score tracking using localStorage
    * Game loop management with `window.requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation
    * Sound effects and background music integration for a more immersive experience

**Key Features:**

* Responsive Design: The game adjusts to different screen sizes using viewport units (vmin) for the board and snake size.
* Smooth Animation: Leveraging `requestAnimationFrame` ensures a visually smooth game experience.
* High Score Tracking: The game stores the highest achieved score in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to track their progress.
* Engaging Audio: Sound effects for food consumption and game over, complemented by background music, enhance gameplay immersion.

**Additional Considerations (Optional):**

* Explain any potential improvements or further development plans you have in mind for the project.
* If you've deployed the game online, provide a link to showcase its functionality.

**Overall, SnakeMania demonstrates your proficiency in web development fundamentals using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases your ability to create an interactive and engaging game with a well-defined structure, clear logic, and an emphasis on user experience.**

By incorporating these key points and considering the optional suggestions, you can effectively highlight your SnakeMania project in your CV, demonstrating your technical skills and passion for web development.
